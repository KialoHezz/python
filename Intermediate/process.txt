Process: An instance of a program(e.g Python Intepreter)

+ Takes advsntage of multiple CPUs and Cores
+ Seperate memory space -> Memory is not shared btn processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes sre interruptable / Killable
+ One Gil for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

+Heavyweight => takes alot of memory
+Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
+ More Memory
+IPC (Inter-process communication) is more coplicated.
