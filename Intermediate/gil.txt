GIL: GLOBAL interpreter lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in python

- Needed in CPython because memory mgt iks not thread-safe

- Avoid:
    - Use Multiproccessing
    - Use a diffferent, frfee-threaded python implementation(Jython, IronPython)
    - Use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries(C/C++) -> numpy, Scipy
