Thread: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also know as leightweight process)
Thread is instruction give to a CPU (Central processing Unit)
A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ leightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a processes
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

-  Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at  a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not Interruptable/killeable 
- Care with race conditions
